# Model Training

The script 'train.sh' contains the command used to train the published Borzoi model ensemble.

Notes:

- Model training is done through the script 'hound_train.py' from the [baskerville-yeast](https://github.com/calico/baskerville-yeast.git) repository.
- Training parameters are specified in a .json file that is supplied to the script. The published model's .json can be found [here](gs://calico-khc-transfer/shorkie_models/Shorkie_LM/ ).
